  \item \textbf{Voting Analysis} (10 points)\\
  For the finale of a TV show, viewers could use either social media or a text message to vote for their favorite of two contestants. The contestant receiving more than $50\%$ of the vote won. An estimated $10\%$ of the viewers voted, and $30\%$ of the votes were cast on social media.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item If all viewers had voted, Contestant 2 would have won.
    \item Viewers voting by social media were likely to be younger than viewers voting by text message.
    \item If all viewers who voted had voted by social media instead of by text message, Contestant 2 would have won.
    \item Viewers voting by social media were more likely to prefer Contestant 2 than were viewers voting by text message.
