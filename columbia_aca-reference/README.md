**Key Points for In-Person Lecturers**

1. **Curriculum & Weekly Binders**  
   - Access the “Summer 2025 DSAT Math Curriculum” in the shared folder.  
   - Students receive a weekly binder containing exactly the curriculum material.  
   - If you adjust pacing (slow down or speed up), notify coordinators so they can delay or advance binder distribution accordingly.

2. **Supplemental Resources**  
   - Additional PDFs live in the shared “DSAT Math” folder.  
   - Use these as needed to enhance or clarify your lessons.

3. **Later-Week Pacing**  
   - Later weeks list fewer topics, anticipating earlier material may spill over.  
   - If students finish early, pull in extra drills (those not used in Weeks 2–3) for additional practice.

4. **Test Materials (Siyi Wang Tests)**  
   - Review every Siyi Wang test carefully—many contain errors.  
   - Wherever a Siyi Wang test is paired with an alternate test, use the alternate if mistakes are excessive.

5. **Google Classroom**  
   - Ensure all students join Google Classroom after Day 1.  
   - Use it to post homework reminders, announcements, and any urgent updates.

6. **Curriculum Notes**  
   - Hover over cell comments in the digital curriculum to view instructor notes.  
   - Read all embedded comments before teaching each lesson.

7. **Professional Expectations**  
   - Arrive at least 15 minutes before class starts.  
   - Dress professionally (close-toed shoes and appropriate attire are required).

8. **Student Engagement**  
   - Be patient and make lessons engaging.  
   - Maintain a supportive atmosphere so every student leaves feeling more confident about the SAT.
