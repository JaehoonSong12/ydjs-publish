  \item \textbf{Bus Travel} (10 points)\\
  A bus traveled on the highway and on local roads to complete a trip of 160 miles. The trip took 4 hours. The bus traveled at an average speed of 55 miles per hour (mph) on the highway and an average speed of 25 mph on local roads. If $x$ is the time, in hours, the bus traveled on the highway and $y$ is the time, in hours, it traveled on local roads, which system of equations represents this situation?\\
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item $\begin{aligned} 55x+25y&=4 \\ x+y&=160 \end{aligned}$
    \item $\begin{aligned} 55x+25y&=160 \\ x+y&=4 \end{aligned}$
    \item $\begin{aligned} 25x+55y&=4 \\ x+y&=160 \end{aligned}$
    \item $\begin{aligned} 25x+55y&=160 \\ x+y&=4 \end{aligned}$
